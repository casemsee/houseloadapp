# House load --- A MATLAB application

Generate and analyze synthetic house electricity load profiles down to minute resolution

This application generates synthetic electricity load profiles of houses using a consumer load model. The user can change select model parameter values and generate data for different time resolutions and periods. The application uses a consumer load model which was published in a scientific journal.
